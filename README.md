# orthogonality_constrained_pls
PLS regression with orthogonality constraint to known interferents.

This repository contains a MATLAB implementation of **Orthogonality-Constrained Partial Least Squares (OC-PLS)** regression. The method enhances selectivity by forcing the latent variable space to be orthogonal to known interfering signals, making it particularly useful in chemometric modeling of vibrational spectroscopy data.
